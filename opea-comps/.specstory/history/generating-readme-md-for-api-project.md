_**User**_

Could you please generate Readme.md which will summarise the project?


Please use this examples as well
curl http://localhost:8008/api/pull -d '{
  "model": "deepseek-r1:1.5b"
}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -d "Why the sky is blue?"

curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"messages": "Why the sky is blue?"}' http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a more comprehensive README.md file that better explains the project and its usage.

# API Service for Language Models

This project provides an API service for interacting with various language models. It supports model management and chat completions through REST API endpoints.

## Features

- Model management (pull, load, unload)
- Chat completions API endpoint
- Compatible with multiple language models
- RESTful API interface

## API Endpoints

### Model Management

Pull a specific model:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8008/api/pull -d '{
  "model": "deepseek-r1:1.5b"
}'
```

### Chat Completions

There are two ways to interact with the chat completions endpoint:

1. Simple query:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -d "Why the sky is blue?"
```

2. JSON format (recommended):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "messages": "Why the sky is blue?"
  }'
```
