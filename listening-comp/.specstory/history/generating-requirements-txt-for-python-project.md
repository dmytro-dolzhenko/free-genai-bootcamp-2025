## Generating requirements.txt for Python project (2/21/2025, 9:23:48 PM)

Could you please populate requirements.txt

_**Assistant**_

I'll help create a requirements.txt file with the necessary dependencies. Based on the code, the main external dependency is the `youtube-transcript-api` package.

```text:requirements.txt
youtube-transcript-api>=0.6.1
```

This package will handle the YouTube transcript functionality. The other imports (`urllib.parse`, `os`, and `typing`) are part of Python's standard library, so they don't need to be included in requirements.txt.

I specified version 0.6.1 or higher since it's a stable version that includes all the functionality used in your code (TextFormatter and transcript fetching). You can also use just `youtube-transcript-api` without the version specifier if you want to always get the latest version, but specifying a minimum version is generally considered good practice for reproducibility.
