Student will provide a sentense in English language which need to be translated into Japanese.  Don't tell student what the actual Japanese translation is. Instead only guide the student using clues.

Start by prompting the student to send the sentence they want to be translated. Don't proceed further until student prompt is received.

Once prompt is received, generate following to help with translation:

vocabulary table
sentence structure
clues
Vocabulary table format
Vocabulary table should have 3 columns and shown as a table: English, Romaji and Japanese.
Provide words in the table from the input sentence in their dictionary form, student needs to figure out conjugations and tenses.

Alright, so I'm trying to help a student translate an English sentence into Japanese without giving away the exact translation. The user wants me to guide them using clues and some tools like a vocabulary table, sentence structure, and hints.

First, I need to prompt the student to send their English sentence. Once they do that, my job is to provide a vocabulary table, the sentence structure, and some clues to help them figure out the translation on their own.

Looking at the provided content, there's a vocabulary table with words like 'book', 'read', 'now', 'is/am/are' and others. I should make sure to include all relevant words from the student's sentence in this table. For example, if the sentence includes 'book', I'll list that in the table.

Next, the sentence structure examples show various patterns without particles. So, for the sentence structure, I need to avoid including particles like 'は' or 'が'. Instead, I should focus on the order of components like subject, verb, object, etc., based on the structures provided.

For clues, I have to be careful not to give away the correct answer. Maybe start with something obvious, like matching words from the vocabulary table. For example, if the sentence has 'book', that's straightforward. Another clue could involve tense or conjugations of verbs like 'read' in Japanese.

I also need to ensure that all provided tools are formatted correctly as tables and structures without markdown, just plain text with bullets and dashes where needed.

Wait, let me double-check the vocabulary table format. It should have three columns: English, Romaji, and Japanese. No markdown, so I'll use plain text with hyphens to make it a table.

For the sentence structure, each part like subject, verb, object, etc., should be clearly listed without any particles or additional information.

Clues should be one or two points that guide the student towards figuring out the correct translation without revealing the answer. Maybe pointing them towards identifying key nouns and verbs, checking the conjugation of verbs, and ensuring proper tense alignment.

I think I've got it. Now, putting it all together, I'll prompt the student for their sentence, then provide the vocabulary table with relevant words, a clear sentence structure without particles, and some guiding clues based on what's in their sentence.

Please proceed by sending me the English sentence you would like to be translated into Japanese.

Once received, I will provide:

Vocabulary table: Matching words from your sentence in dictionary form (English, Romaji, and Japanese).
Sentence structure: Basic pattern without particles.
Clues: 1-2 hints to help with translation, without giving away the correct answer.

Okay, so I need to translate the English sentence "I love to play football" into Japanese, but I don't want to just give the student the direct translation. Instead, I should guide them using clues based on the provided content.

First, I'll prompt the user to send their English sentence so I can start guiding them. Once they provide it, I need to generate a vocabulary table, sentence structure without particles, and some clues.

Looking at the vocabulary table from the example, I see entries like "book," "read," "now," and verbs like "is/am/are." Since the user's sentence includes words like "love," "play," and "football," I should include these in the vocabulary table. So the vocabulary table should have columns for English, Romaji, and Japanese.

Next, the sentence structure example shows patterns like [Subject] [Adjective] or [Subject] [Verb] [Location]. The user's sentence is a simple present statement: Subject (I) + Verb (love) + Object (football) + Adjective (to play). So I can structure it as "[Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Adjective]." This helps the student identify key parts of the sentence.

For clues, I need to provide hints without giving away the exact translation. The most important clue would be related to the verb "love." Since "love" is a base form, in Japanese it's usually "suki desu" (好きです). So I can tell the student that this part is common and might end with "desu."

Another clue could relate to the word "football," which translates to "soccer" in some contexts. But since we want to avoid giving away the exact translation, I can say it's a sport that people enjoy watching or playing.

Putting it all together, I'll start by prompting the student for their sentence and then provide the vocabulary table, sentence structure, and clues based on the analysis.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Vocabulary Table:

English: love, play, football
Romaji: suki desu (love), yaru (play), soccer (football)
Japanese: 好きです (suki desu), 遊る (yaru), サッカー (soccer)
Sentence Structure:

The structure of the sentence is "[Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Adjective]."
Clues:

Adjective Clue: Look for an adjective that ends with "desu" or similar endings, as this is common in Japanese.
Object Clue: Identify a noun related to sports that might be known as "soccer" or another term.
By using these clues, the student can deduce the correct Japanese translation without it being provided directly.

Alright, so I'm trying to help this student translate their English sentence into Japanese without giving away the exact translation. The user wants me to guide them using clues based on the vocabulary table and sentence structure provided earlier.

First off, let's break down what they've given me. The original English sentence is "I love to play football." The task is to translate this into Japanese without revealing the correct answer. Instead, I need to provide a vocabulary table, a sentence structure, and some clues to help them figure it out.

Looking at the vocabulary table, the words provided are 'love', 'play', and 'football'. Their dictionary forms in English, Romaji, and Japanese are:

Love: 愛 (ai) in English, 恨る (otenaru) in Romaji, 好き (suki) in Japanese.
Play: 遊る (yaru) in both Romaji and Japanese.
Football: サッカー (sakka) in Japanese.
Wait, hold on. I think there's a confusion here. 'Football' is already provided as "football" which translates to "サッカー". So the student needs to recognize that "football" becomes "サッカー".

Next, looking at the sentence structure, it's "[Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Adjective]." In this case, the subject is 'I', the verb is 'love' or 'like', the object is 'to play football', and the adjective is 'football' in a sense.

Now, for clues. The first clue should be about the adjective because adjectives often have specific endings in Japanese. Since 'love' translates to '好き (suki)', which ends with 'ki', the clue could be something like "Look for an adjective that ends with 'ki' or similar." But wait, '好き' is actually written as '好きです (suki desu)' when used as a sentence ending.

Hmm, maybe I should adjust that. Alternatively, since 'love' becomes '好き', which uses the Romaji 'desu' for polite sentences, perhaps the clue is about recognizing the particle 'です (desu)' at the end.

Wait, no. The structure shouldn't include particles, so maybe it's better to focus on the adjective itself.

Another thought: Since the verb 'play' is translated as 遊る (yaru), which is a conjugated form for playing, but actually 'yaru' can mean both 'to play' and 'to have fun', depending on context. So perhaps the clue could be about finding a verb that might end with 'ru' or similar.

But I need to avoid giving away the correct translation, so maybe it's better to guide based on known vocabulary words and sentence structure.

Also, considering the object 'football', which is 'サッカー' in Japanese, so if the student knows that 'football' translates to 'サッカー', they can connect it properly.

Putting this together, the clues would be:

The sentence ends with an adjective that starts with 'suki' or 'ai' and ends with specific endings like 'desu'.
Identify the object related to sports, such as '足球 (soccer)' or another term.
But since we're not supposed to include particles in the structure, maybe focusing on the form of the sentence rather than the ending particles is better.

Alternatively, since the structure is "[Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Adjective]," the student can focus on identifying each part based on the vocabulary table and structure without worrying about particles like 'です (desu)' yet.

So, in summary, I should provide a vocabulary table with 'love', 'play', 'football' along with their Romaji and Japanese forms, a sentence structure of "[Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Adjective]," and two clues to help them deduce the translation without giving away the exact answer.

Here is a structured guide based on the provided information:

Vocabulary Table
English	Romaji	Japanese
love	suki	好き
play	yaru	遊る
football	sakka (サッカー)	サッカー
Sentence Structure
The sentence structure is as follows:

[Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Adjective]
Clues to Help with Translation
Adjective Clue:
The sentence ends with an adjective that starts with "suki" or another similar term, which will be in the form of a polite expression ending with "です (desu)".
Object Clue:
Identify the object related to sports, such as "football," which translates to "サッカー (sakka)."
By using these clues and understanding the vocabulary table and sentence structure, you should be able to construct the correct Japanese translation without it being provided directly.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the user is asking for. The student wants me to provide a response that guides them in translating an English sentence into Japanese without revealing the actual translation. So, my role here is to help the student figure out how to translate on their own using clues, vocabulary, and sentence structure.

The original query was: "I love to play football."

I'll start by creating a vocabulary table based on the words in the sentence. The key words are "love," "play," and "football." Translating these into Japanese, I get:

Love -> 好き (suki)
Play -> 遊る (yaru)
Football -> サッカー (sakka)
Next, I'll outline the sentence structure without including particles. The structure here is: [Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Adjective].

Then, I'll provide clues to help the student:

Adjective Clue: Look for an adjective that ends with "suki" or another similar polite expression.
Object Clue: Identify a noun related to sports, such as "football," which translates to "サッカー."
By giving these clues and the vocabulary table, the student can deduce the correct Japanese translation without it being directly provided.

Now, in response to the user's latest query: "好き 遊る サッカー" (suki yaru sakka), I'll use the same approach.

I'll create a new vocabulary table focusing on "like," "play," and "football." Then, outline the sentence structure again and provide two clues to guide the translation without revealing the exact answer.

This method ensures that the student practices translating sentences independently while having structured guidance.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

Vocabulary Table:

English: like, play, football
Romaji: suki (好き), yaru (遊る), sakka (サッカー)
Japanese: 好き (suki), 遊る (yaru), サッカー (sakka)
Sentence Structure:

The structure of the sentence is: "[Subject] [Verb] [Object] [Adjective]."
Clues to Help with Translation:

Adjective Clue:

Identify an adjective that ends with "suki" or another polite expression, such as "好き (suki)." This will be used to express liking or enjoying something.
Object Clue:

Look for a noun related to activities, specifically one that might be associated with sports like "football," which translates to "サッカー."
By using these clues and the provided vocabulary table, you should be able to construct the correct Japanese translation without it being directly revealed.
